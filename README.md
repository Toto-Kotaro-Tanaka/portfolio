## UX 5 PLANES

### Strategy Plane

Users are potential employers, or people who may link me with them. By creating a simple design website where I keep all the projects that I create during my study in Code Institute, users can see them easily, and they know what my projects are like. By providing a link to my LinkedIn page, users can also see histories of my education, work and skills.
Below are the features implemented on the website.

-   Main page with a log, link to “Project” section, link to LinkedIn and GitHub
-   Brief introduction and the technologies I can use
-   Contact e-mail address in case they would like to contact me

### Scope Plane

Features to be included on this projects are;
Navigation bar with logo, links to Project page, LinkedIn and GitHub

### Structure Plane

The website consists of 2 pages (sections). One is Home and other one is Project.
